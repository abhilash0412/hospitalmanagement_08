| `Dr. Rajesh Sharma`   | `pass1`  |
| `Dr. Priya Patel`     | `pass2`  |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5**: For the structure and content of the web page.
* **CSS3**: For styling, layout (Flexbox & Grid), and responsiveness.
* **JavaScript (ES6)**: For form validation, DOM manipulation, and user interactions.

***

## üìÅ File Structure

The project is self-contained within a single file for simplicity:

* **`index.html`**: Contains the HTML structure, all CSS styles within a `<style>` block, and all JavaScript logic within a `<script>` block.
* **`doctor-dashboard.html` (Hypothetical)**: This is the page the user is redirected to upon successful login. It is **not included** in this project and would need to be created separately.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

This project serves as a great starting point. Here are some potential features that could be added:

* **Create the Doctor Dashboard**: Build out the `doctor-dashboard.html` page to provide actual functionality for logged-in users.
* **Backend Integration**: Replace the hard-coded JavaScript object with a real backend service (e.g., using Node.js, Python, or PHP) for secure authentication and database management.
* **"Forgot Password" Feature**: Implement a password reset flow.
* **Enhanced Form Validation**: Add more robust client-side and server-side validation rules.
* **Session Management**: Use cookies or tokens for more persistent login sessions.
